            <h1>Introducing <u>Spectramind!</u></h1>
            <p>An interactive app developed by Team Binary Bandits to support people who suffer
                from mental problems and disorders like Autism and Dyslexia.</p><br><br>

                <h3>Dyslexia</h3>
                <p>Dyslexia is a specific learning disorder that primarily affects reading and spelling abilities. It is characterized by difficulties in
                 accurately and fluently recognizing words, poor decoding skills, and challenges in phonological processing. People with dyslexia may also 
                 experience difficulties with writing, math, and organization skills. Dyslexia is not related to intelligence, and individuals with dyslexia 
                 often have strengths in other areas, such as problem-solving or creativity.</p>

            <div class="problems-col">
                <h3>Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD)</h3>
                <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication, social interaction, and behavior. It is characterized 
                by a range of symptoms and challenges, which can vary widely from person to person. People with ASD may have difficulty with social interactions, 
                exhibit repetitive behaviors, experience sensory sensitivities, and have intense interests in specific topics. ASD is a lifelong condition, but early
                intervention and appropriate support can greatly enhance an individual's quality of life and their ability to navigate the world.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="problems-col">
                <h3>Other mental health disorders</h3>
                <p>Anxiety, insomnia, and depression are common mental disorders that affect many individuals. Anxiety involves persistent feelings of fear 
                and worry, while insomnia refers to difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Depression, on the other hand, is characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest,
                and feelings of worthlessness. These conditions can significantly impact daily functioning and overall well-being. However, with proper support, including therapy, medication, 
                and self-care strategies, individuals can manage and overcome these challenges, leading to improved mental health and quality of life.</p>
